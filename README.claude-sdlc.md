# ferrum — Claude Code SDLC config

This repository has a **claude-kit** autonomous-SDLC configuration installed. Claude Code reads it
automatically when you open the project; nothing here is application code.

- **Stack:** stack-agnostic (no stack lanes selected)
- **SDLC profile:** Standard — full SDLC, parallel lanes, security gate
- **MCP integrations:** chrome-devtools, github
- **Installed:** ~29 agents · 43 skills · stack overlay rules
  (none)

## What got installed

```
CLAUDE.md                  entry point — rules + your stack's commands ("Project-specific rules")
README.claude-sdlc.md      this file
.claude/
  settings.json            hooks (working memory, learnings, guardrails, quality checks)
  rules/                   the engineering rule set + your stack's overlay rules
  agents/                  the SDLC agents for the chosen profile (+ stack specialists)
  skills/                  on-demand skills, including sdlc/ — the pipeline entry point
  hooks/                   the hook scripts referenced by settings.json
  templates/               artifact templates (feature-spec, adr, test-plan, …)
  config/                  init-options.json (selection + checksums) + the catalog snapshot
  state/  tmp/             runtime scratch (gitignored)
.mcp.json                  the MCP servers you selected (fill in the ${ENV} placeholders)
```

How Claude Code discovers it: `CLAUDE.md` is loaded as project context; `.claude/agents/*.md`,
`.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`, and the hooks in `.claude/settings.json` are auto-discovered;
`.mcp.json` (if present) registers MCP servers.

## Privacy — learning capture

Learning capture is **ON for this install** (`session-end-catchup`, chosen at init): a background Claude
job reads your session transcript and changed files to record durable learnings under
`.claude/agent-memory/` (a committed store). It skips secret-bearing files (`.env`, `*.pem`/`*.key`,
`credentials.*`) and redacts secret-shaped values, but transcripts can still hold sensitive context —
**review new `agent-memory/` entries before committing them**. Controls:

- `CKIT_NO_AUTOCAPTURE=1` — disable capture entirely.
- `CKIT_CAPTURE_MAX_LINES` / `CKIT_CAPTURE_MAX_BYTES` — bound what each run feeds the job.
- `claude-kit privacy-report` — audit every installed hook: what it reads/writes, whether a
  background job spawns, and how to disable it.


## Start the workflow

Open the project in Claude Code and run the pipeline entry point:

```
/sdlc Build JWT authentication for the backend
```

The orchestrator asks a few ordered questions, classifies the work, then delegates to specialist
agents through the pipeline phases — enforcing a quality gate between each. With this profile the
active gates are: **Standard — full SDLC, parallel lanes, security gate**.

You can also invoke any single skill directly (e.g. `/spec-driven-development`, `/code-review-and-quality`)
or ask Claude to use a specific agent.

The versioned headless-loop interface ships at `.claude/scripts/sdlc-loop.sh`, but new unattended
iterations currently fail closed before a host process starts. Portable process groups cannot prove
containment of deliberately detached descendants, so the kit does not mint an automated gate-
transition token. Use the interactive lifecycle; the script can still strictly validate an already-
completed run. See the autonomous-operation guide before relying on a future promotion.

## Core rules (non-negotiable)

- Never read or print secrets. Never run destructive commands without confirmation.
- Plan before large edits; write a spec before implementing a feature.
- Run the project's validation (lint, type-check, tests) before declaring work complete.

See `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/rules/` for the full set.

## Extending the config

- **Add a stack** (frontend framework, backend language/framework, or database): add an entry to the
  claude-kit catalog and a `templates/stacks/<stack_dir>/` folder with overlay rules — then re-run
  `claude-kit init`. It's a data change, not code.
- **Add a skill / agent:** drop a `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` or `.claude/agents/<name>.md`.
- **Enable MCP later:** add servers to `.mcp.json` (see `claude-kit list-options` for the catalog).
- **Upgrade safely:** `claude-kit diff` to preview, then `claude-kit upgrade` (your edits are backed
  up, never silently overwritten). `claude-kit doctor` checks config health.

## Organization-wide vibe-coding capabilities

claude-kit isn't just for one developer. Engineers, PMs, designers, QA, DevOps, security, data,
support, and founders can all drive work in natural language — creating features, fixing bugs, writing
tests, reviewing code, generating docs, shipping releases, and maintaining systems — through a shared,
safe, consistent set of **skills · agents · rules · hooks · workflows · MCP**.

- **This project's scope:** `individual`
- **The vocabulary:** *Skills* are reusable playbooks (slash commands). *Agents* are specialized
  workers with isolated context and tool limits. *Rules* are always-on (or path-scoped) conventions.
  *Hooks* are deterministic checks at lifecycle events. *Workflows* orchestrate agents+skills.
  *MCP* connects Claude to GitHub, Jira, Linear, databases, browsers, and docs.

### 1. Skills for org-wide reusable workflows
`/sdlc` (the pipeline), `/spec-driven-development`, `/planning-and-task-breakdown`,
`/code-review-and-quality`, `/test-driven-development`, `/security-and-hardening`, `/threat-model`,
`/accessibility-review`, `/performance-optimization`, `/shipping-and-launch`, `/refresh-docs` (organization scope adds the five non-engineer
playbooks: feature-from-idea, prompt-to-safe-task, prototype-to-production, customer-issue-to-fix,
repo-onboarding).

### 2. Agents by role/team
Orchestration/quality: `orchestrator`, `risk-classifier`, `sdlc-code-reviewer`, `acceptance-reviewer`,
`merge-reviewer`, `devils-advocate`. Product: `spec-doc-writer`, `story-planner`,
`ui-designer`. Planning review: `senior-backend-reviewer`, `senior-frontend-reviewer`,
`technical-architect`, `em-reviewer`. Engineering: `developer`, `senior-backend-dev`,
`senior-frontend-dev` (+ DB specialists). Quality: `tester`, `unit-tester`, `e2e-tester`,
`senior-tester`. Security/reliability: `security-reviewer`, `owasp-reviewer`, `secret-scanner`,
`dependency-scanner`, `policy-validator`, `devops-engineer`, `observability-engineer`,
`incident-responder`.

### 3. Rules to share across repositories
`mandatory-workflow`, `quality-gates`, `autonomy-levels`, `risk-classification`, `human-in-the-loop`,
`agent-guardrails`, plus the policy set `secrets-policy`, `pii-policy`, `production-data-policy`,
`branch-and-pr-policy`, `compliance-policy`, and the vibe-coding set `prompt-to-task-conversion`,
`non-engineer-safe-coding`, `prototype-boundaries`, `ambiguity-resolution`.

### 4. Hooks to enforce for safety & quality
`guard-rm-rf` (dangerous shell), `protect-secrets` + `guard-commit-secrets` (secrets),
`warn-sensitive-files` (auth/payments/migrations/infra), `validate-frontmatter` + `validate-settings`,
`warn-large-edits`, `warn-missing-tests`, `audit-log` (local, org mode), `lint-fix`, `type-check`.
Conservative by default; higher autonomy levels enable more. Disable any per-repo in
`.claude/settings.local.json`.

### 5. Optional MCP integrations
GitHub (issues/PRs), Jira/Linear (tickets), the project database (read), Playwright (browser/E2E),
and Context7 (live library docs). Select at init; they land in `.mcp.json` with `${ENV}` placeholders.

### 6. Distributing capabilities across projects
| Layer | Lives in | Use for |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Project** | `.claude/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.mcp.json` (committed) | what this repo needs — the per-repo source of truth |
| **User** | `~/.claude/` (per developer, not committed) | personal preferences, personal skills, local overrides |
| **Organization** | reusable packs / plugins, versioned + changelogged in an approved registry | shared, governed capabilities adopted across repos |

**Never commit:** local secrets, `.env`, personal tokens, personal `settings.local.json`.
(Planned: `claude-sdlc package-org-pack` / `install-org-pack` to package + install approved packs.)

## Autonomy model

How much Claude may do before a human acts (set per repo; default `assisted`). Full detail in
`.claude/rules/autonomy-levels.md`.

| Level | May do | Must not, without a human |
|-------|--------|----------------------------|
| advisory | inspect · explain · plan · review | edit files unless asked |
| assisted *(default)* | edit after explaining the plan | broad/cross-cutting changes without asking |
| autonomous-local | implement locally + run validation | push, open PRs, leave the repo |
| autonomous-pr | create branches + PR-ready changes | **merge** (human review required) |
| enterprise-controlled | work through strict gates + audit | edit sensitive files / complete without security + review |

## Risk classification

Every task is classified **low · medium · high · restricted** before work starts
(`.claude/rules/risk-classification.md`). High-risk areas — authentication, authorization, payments,
secrets, production data, database migrations, infrastructure, security controls, compliance, destructive
operations, dependency upgrades, many-file changes — require: a plan · explicit approval · security
review · test review · rollback notes · a residual-risk summary. Restricted work cannot start without
written human authorization.

## Governance & adoption

- **Add a skill/agent:** create it in the kit's `templates/org/…`, list it in the pack's `pack.yaml`,
  document it in the pack README. **Reuse before creating** — never add a competing duplicate.
- **Retire duplicates:** prefer one canonical component; deprecate aliases via `/deprecation-and-migration`.
- **Approve hooks & sensitive rules:** security/DevOps review before rollout; keep hooks conservative.
- **Version & roll out:** version packs, keep a changelog, roll out repo-by-repo with `claude-kit diff`
  then `claude-kit upgrade` (edits are backed up).
- **Different teams, different autonomy:** choose the level per repo (a regulated service vs an internal tool).
- **Collect feedback:** capture recurring prompts (→ new skills) and recurring mistakes (→ new rules)
  via the `remember` skill.

### Metrics worth tracking
tasks completed through `/sdlc` · PRs created with Claude assistance · test-coverage change · escaped
defects · review comments per PR · idea→PR time · security findings caught pre-merge · rollback
frequency · docs updated with code · unsafe actions blocked by hooks · repeated prompts that should
become skills · repeated mistakes that should become rules.

## Examples

```text
# Engineer — behavior-preserving refactor (reads files, classifies risk, plans, proposes tests,
#            small changes, invokes code + test review)
/code-simplification Simplify the billing service without changing behavior

# QA — regression coverage (finds modules, proposes unit/integration/e2e tests, writes + validates,
#      summarizes coverage gaps)
/test-driven-development Add regression coverage for failed password-reset links
```
